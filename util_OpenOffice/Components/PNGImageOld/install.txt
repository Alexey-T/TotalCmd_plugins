To install the PNG library.

Decompress all of the files. Include the location of the 'PNG'
directory in Delphi's library paths. To do this, launch Delphi
and select 'Environment Options...' from the 'Tools' menu. Next,
click on the 'Library'tab and add the location of the folder to
the 'Library Paths' string (e.g. add 'c:\borland\png;'). Press 
the 'OK' button.

To load the sample application, choose 'Open' from the file menu
and select the file PNGproj.dpr
